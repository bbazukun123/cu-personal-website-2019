                "detail":"A web-based, side scrolling MOBA game concept under the name of Twilight of Gods (ToG) was the first project of Chomasoft Company Limited in 2014. I was in charge in experimenting with the design of the user interface of the game's external menu. The process initiated with plenty of rough sketches of the original concept of the external menu UI along with the in-game UI. These sketches then proceeded towards high-fidelity renders (These renders and character designs like in image #10, #11 and #12 were hand drawn and coloured by our talented graphic designer, Sariya Assawametha)<br><br>Being excited for a sophisticated 2D skeletal animation tool back at the time called Spine 2D, I was eager to learn how to rig, animate, morph texture, and add visual effects. I then went on the showcase basic animations for one of the main characters, Seluwardje. Additionally, I also had the opportunity to develop a website prototype for the game as well. Unfortunately, the project came to a complete halt during the process of implementation.",
