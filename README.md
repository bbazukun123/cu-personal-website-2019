# Personal Website 2019

This repo contains codes and assets for my new [Personal Website](https://chanodom-utsahajit.netlify.com) (excluding content images). The idea was to develop a **single page application (SPA)** without using any JavaScript framework or library in an attempt to build a stronger understanding of vanilla JavaScript before moving towards employing libraries and frameworks.  

## Built With

* HTML5
* Sass
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Gulp
* Parcel

## Notes

- The codes currently exhibits a range of styles due to the progressive learning along the way since I was a complete beginner at web development at the beginning of the project. The website is currently being recoded to better compartmentalise, optimise and improve comprehensability.
- As the website has only been launched quite recently, any reports on problems/bugs or feedbacks will be very much appreciated. Please kindly email me at [bzkwork1993@gmail.com](mailto:bzkwork1993@gmail.com). Cheers! :)
