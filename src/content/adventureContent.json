We ended up planning for an ambitious cycling trip from London to Bruges and back to Dover with a total distance of over 320km. The trip spanned over 4 days, where we agreed to take a day off and be tourists for a day in Bruges.<br><br>Days before the trip, I was totally excited but also anxious at the same time because the total distance was way above our records and I have never cycled anywhere in Europe before, let alone been to Belgium.<br><br>In the end, the trip turned out to be an absolute blast! It was exhausting but worth every drop of sweat. Not only were there roads and paths specifically for cyclists from Dunkirk straight to Bruges, but the views and weather were perfect. Definitely a must-come-back!",

Although, those routes were not meant to be easy at all! With challenging hills and roaring winds and even heavy rain on the 2nd day, I found that I was struggling to keep up with everyone else.<br><br>Nevertheless, I managed to complete all the routes and break away my mental barriers with all the support from my friends and coaching from the uncle. This trip has ultimately allowed me to double my weekly long cycle distance and made me enjoy cycling in a way I never used to!"

Luckily, I was travelling with my 2 senior friends from my course who were experts on planning this kind of trip. Prior to the departure, I did not know what to expect at all from this 10 days journey.<br><br>We have travelled to various beautiful cities including Rabat, Casablanca, Fes, Chefchaouen and Marrakesh. The highlight of the trip was the long road trip we took towards the Sahara desert where we got to witness breathtaking landscapes and experience the local charms. This was followed by overnight camping in Sahara desert where we got to eat, sing and dance by the campfire under the clear starry sky. We also got to travel on camels’ back and sandboard down the giant sand dunes!<br><br>As the trip came to an end, I looked back at the hardships I have encountered in the first couple of days like the culture unfamiliarity, the disconnection from the technology and that my mobile phone was pickpocketed for examples. And in the process, I came to realise that these hardships actually made the trip much more delightful. Through disconnection and unfamiliarity, I was able to savour the moments, try new things and really get to know the people; locals and other travellers alike."
